# Library Management System

This project is a **Library Management System** built in **C#**. It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage library operations such as adding, removing, viewing, and purchasing books. The system supports two roles: **Library Manager** and **User**.

## Features

- **Library Manager Role**:
  - Add new books to the library.
  - Remove books from the library.
  - View all books available in the library.
  
- **User Role**:
  - View available books in the library.
  - Buy a book from the library.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles Used

This project is designed with a focus on OOP principles, including:

1. Encapsulation: Data and behaviors are encapsulated within classes.
2. Inheritance: Shared properties and behaviors are inherited from the abstract Person class.
3. Polymorphism: Different roles have different functionalities.
4. Abstraction: The abstract Person class provides a blueprint for concrete classes.
5. Composition: The Library class is composed of a collection of Book objects.
